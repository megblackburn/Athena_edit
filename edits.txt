- have added a folder utils, with files hst_func.h, townsend_cooling_max.h, code_units.h
- have added mixlayershift.c - c version with some edits - unsure if it will fully run
- mix_layerShift.cpp is the cpp version

- had to hard code all values in code_units
- unit_q was an issue - doesnt seem to get used
- havent got an hst_func 
- MPI_ATHENA and MPI_allreduce are in mesh.cpp/init_mesh.c - need to add mpiallreduce with mpi_athena
- Mesh: newtimestep??? first mentions MPI ath and allreduce
- next section by Hitesh is large - try convert and add into init_mesh.c - MAKE A COPY 
- apart from that it is compiling after changing MPI MACHINE in Makeoptions.in 


./configure --with-problem=mls --enable-mpi
